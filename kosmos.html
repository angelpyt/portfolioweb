            <h5>Kosmos is a iPhone App designed for people who use cosmetics products to help them find and use safe beauty products. It attempts to allow users to keep track the expiration date of all their beauty products, organize their own products more efficiently, help them to identify the different ingredients and give them general tips of beauty products to further allow them to find and use more natural and safe products. This is my capstone project, I collaborated with 3 person student group and I am the lead UX/UI designer in the team.</h5>

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>More and more people are using makeup or skincare products to not only be more attractive but also to protect and improve their skin quality. However, since most of these products contain chemical elements in them, there are not 100% safe for human body and could lead to some negative effects if not use properly. Just like food has expiration dates, so as cosmetics products which has been ignored by many users of the products. Studies have shown that expired beauty products would stop working and even give users a risk of infection, or even cause skin irritation. <br> As people tend to have more and more cosmetics products, ranging from skincare, eyeliner to lipstick and foundation, sometimes it is just hard to keep track of the expiration date of each product and the time to acquire new products once the old one is tossed. Besides more and more people today focus more on the ingredients of the products and hope to find more natural products that will reduce the risk of any harms. So being able to understand the different ingredients and identify the toxic ones are important for many users and will affect their choices in the products.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Design Process</h3><br>
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>In this project, I first brainstormed and sketched 40 ideas that might address our design problem. 20 of them are ideas that have already existed and we used them for inspiration. I also came up with other 20 ideas have not existed yet.</p>
            <div class="h-30"></div>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/idea.png"  alt=""></a>
            <br>
            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Based on our design problems, we created three personas and scenarios that feature personas using our product under different occasions, and with different purposes.</p>
            <br>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/persona.png"  alt=""></a>
            <br><br><br>

            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
            <h5>Interview</h5>
            <p>After brainstorming and analyzing personas, I interviewed 2 people and asked about what are their drinking patterns and what are some expectations they have for the problem.  And I noticed that keeping track of the amount of drinks people consume would help them to drink responsibly and avoid from dangers like alcohol poisoning. When attempting to ask people to drink responsibly, I need to consider not only their tolerance, but also feedbacks from their current state. </p>

            <h5>features</h5>
            <p>Then our team started to brainstorm features of our App. During discussion, we decided to have the following features: A standard drink counter, a BAC estimator (tolerance calculator), reminders to drink water and eat snacks, resources on drug interactions and alcohol effects, safe ride options, and finally tips to help you, or your friend that got to intoxicated out. However, after conducting another round of interviews, I found out drinking alert would be helpful to help people control themselves while drinking. So I suggested to add a feature for users to set limit and being able to alert them when they exceed their preset amount.</p><br>


            <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
            <p>We started to draw sketches to illustrate our ideas. We decided to create two version of sketches on two different platforms. The first sketch is a mobile application and the second sketch is a web application. I made the web app for drinking tracker which consists three functions, tracking, safety and information. After conducting usability tests on both sketches, we decided to implement the mobile app instead of web app. Because most people stated they would prefer use mobile app while drinking. My users, a lot of them mentioned that it is hard for people to use web applications while they are drinking since people don’t usually view websites using their phon</p>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/sketch.png" alt=""></a>
            <br>


            <br><br><br>
            <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
            <p>After sketching, we started to make a prototype of our app based on feedbacks we received from the first paper sketch usability tests. The main item of feedback we got back from our first sketch was that it would be too complex for an intoxicated person to use. In our drink tracker, instead of listing past drinks and other information, we just included the current number of drinks, how many away from the target, and the ability to add a drink. It should keep the important function while being simple and easy to use. I first created a prototype using LucidChart. There were some key points that I kept in mind when designing the prototype. First, it must be a mobile application. Second, the buttons must be big enough for users to see and tap under drunk condition. Third, Instead of text description, use more visual graphical tools for quicker and better understanding.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Iterations</h4>
            <h5>First Iteration</h5>
            <p>After creating the first LucidChart prototype, I noticed that Axure is a great software that can help me to create prototypes in a easy way. I decided to use Axure in order to make a more realistic and professional prototype. </p>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/la.png" alt=""></a>
            <br>
            <h5>Second Iteraction</h5>
            <p>Every week during designing, I found out some flaws and defects of our application, I revised our application all the time. Besides the small revisions I made weekly, I also went through a last stage revision to embellish our application. After the first Axure prototype I made earlier, I made some major revisions to the application according to the heuristic evaluation I wrote.</p><br>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/you.png" alt=""></a>
            <br>
            <li>I changed all the fonts to Apple Gothic.</li>
            <li>Instead of using background as color distinguishability, I decided to use top bar to display different colors for different functions. For example, red color for Drinking Tracker.</li>
            <li>I changed the numbers smaller since from reflection, users feel the large number seems to be promoting them to drink. I also added a process bar to visually showing users the current state compared to the their preset limit.</li>
            <li>I also added a quickly add recent drinks function for users. If users are drunk, they might find difficult to add drinks, and most likely they will add drinks they had before from researches I did. Users are still able to explore other drinks through the top right add button. </li>
            <br><br>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/ai.png" alt=""></a>
            <br>
             <p>In the original proposal, my group member Matthew suggests that we should have a reminder for users to alert them to drink water or eat snacks. Therefore, I added the reminder feature under setting. Users are able to set their reminders, including the time duration they want to the application to alert them and snooze time they can skip for a while. At the time they set to remind, the application will alert them and background will turn to dark red and users can either press OK or Snooze to remind them again later.</p><br>
             <br>
             <a><img class="img-responsive" style= "height= 80%" src="img/3/t.png" alt=""></a><br>
             <p style="font-weight:bold">Help and documentation</p>
             <p>Drinking tracker is the main feature of our app. However, in order stay simple, some signs might be ambiguous and hard to understand what it does. So I think having a quick tutorial for first time users in order for them to understand how to use quick add, or standard add drinks. <br>I also made a Quick Tutorial page for the first time users open the Drinking Tracker page since there are two ways users can add drinks. I think it is better to show them which one has what functions will be more straightforward. </p><br>
             <br>


            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
            <p>I tested the first LucidChart prototype one of the representative users from the class, and I found some potential problems as well as strengths. I recorded my tester’s positive and negative feedbacks about the prototypes. And afterwards, I analyze the feedback and focus on how we can change and improve our prototypes based on the critiques. Therefore, I made some revisions according to the critiques I received.</p><br>
            <blockquote>When Yiying first used the drinking buddy app, she was confusing about the hierarchy about the application. Because some of the icons have similar shapes and it made her thought that they all did one function.</blockquote>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/1.png" alt=""></a><br><br>

            <blockquote>Also, she mentioned some words are very vague and ambiguous. For example, goal, she didn’t know what goal is setting for people to limit their drink since we didn’t specify it. Also, add your own was confusing as well, she suggested it would be better if we change it to add your own drinks.</blockquote>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/2.png" alt=""></a><br><br>

            <blockquote>Mike noticed that the unit for drink is not clear as well, whether is it measured as cup, or ounces.</blockquote>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/3.png" alt=""></a><br><br>

            <blockquote>Stefanie suggested when people click some buttons, we can change the color of the button in order to let users more easily to use. For example, the button for reminds user when they hit their goal, otherwise, people wouldn’t know if button was selected or not.</blockquote>
            <a><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3/5.png" alt=""></a><br><br>
            <p>I took the advise from Stefanie and added the feature that when users select one of the button, that button will show up the matching color as the page. </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Wireframes & Interaction Flow</h3>
            <p>Our paper prototype features six tasks: drinking tracker, tolerance calculator, drinking statistics, set drinking goals, access to different transportation and access to drinking information. We then did two usability tests using the low-fidelity prototype with potential users, we also did evaluation session in class to gather feedback and ideas. Based on the feedback we got from our paper prototype, we iterated on our design decisions and created the wireframes of most of the screens of our app. </p><br>
